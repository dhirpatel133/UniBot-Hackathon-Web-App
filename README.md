# UniBot-Hackathon-Web-App
UniBot is the way to go! A first ever web app dedicated towards connecting high school students with postsecondary students and alumni.
Through first hand interaction, UniBot allows high school students to learn more about the potential programs at a university. High school students can interact with  postsecondary students and alumni's through the currently implemented real time messaging option. In the future, a voice call and video call option will be implemented.
